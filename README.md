# Web Component HTML formatter and syntax highlighter

## What does it solve?

This extension has been created to improve development of Web Components created with JavaScript or TypeScript. It syntax highlights HTML inside ES6 string literals, formats and indents.

## Usage

Use `/*html*/` to let VS Code know which literals to apply it to.

It will format the document on save, if enabled, and with the format keybinding `shift+alt+f`
